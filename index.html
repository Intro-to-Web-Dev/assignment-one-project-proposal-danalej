        <!--Mission Statement-->
        
        <p>The goal of this website is to create a platform for coffee consumers to be able to explore new coffe shops based on the suggestions of baristas and shop owners. Allowing for new experiences in the coffee community.
            By creating a network of suggestions from owners and baristas in industry, a network of suggestions could be available for people travelling or wanting to experience something new. With a trusted suggestion and base, it could shed light on an ever expanding community.
        </p>
        <!--What site I want to use as a template-->
        
        <p>I would like to model after sprudge.com as they are the website tracking closest to what I am hoping to accomplish. Sprudge writes reviews on the community and has a searchable database based on location. I am hoping to remove the gap of third party and allow owners
            to make personal recommendations on where they go and what they find exciting. I believe this would allow for a unique experience for both industry heads and users.
        </p>

        <!--Pages and Functions of pages listed below-->
        
        <p>Home Page - The home page will be a simple welcome page with a photo backdrop and a search bar. This will allow the user to input the city name or zip code to begin looking for recommendations.</p>
   
        <p>About Us - This page will contain a quick mission statement about the pages purpose. It will explain how the suggestions are aggregated and tailored to what they may be looking for.</p>
        
        <p>Random suggestion page - This page will be for a rotating suggestion of a random coffee shop to look into. I think this would be a fun feature for the user.</p>
        
        <p>Contact Us - This page will exist for both users and coffee industry people to contact the admin. Ideally the website will receive submissions from coffee shop owners suggesting other shops both locally and nationally for network connection to their own.</p>
        
        <p>Coffee Education Page - This page will be available to provide the user with a base knowledge of coffee. The page will include a brief shot of the process from farming to espresso/brewing in their favorite shops!</p>
        
        <!--Target Audience-->

        <p>The target audience for this website will be coffee consumers and employees (shop owners and baristas). Eventually I would like it to include coffee roasters and having the same template extended to coffee roasteries and shops.</p>
